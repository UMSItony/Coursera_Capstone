    "My final project focuses on choosing a minority-owned or minority-serving small businesses for relief from COVID-19 shutdowns and looting of communities that continue to tear down black communities in New York City. With over 200,000 COVID-19 cases in New York according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_York_(state)), the most at-risk residents also live in areas prone to being food deserts and are increasingly relying on neighborhood institutions with established presence in the community for not only sustenance, but as a necessary resource for community economic vitality. Providing opportunities for others to step outside their comfort zone and explore new communities and cultures often involves sharing appealing cuisines at thriving neighborhood restaurants. This exploration will identify which neighborhoods and boroughs have the most opportunity for leveraging the unifying cultural relevance of soul food.\n",

    "2. Where do I go in New York if I want a culturally-relevant immersive experience while patronizing a minority-owned or minority-serving establishment?"
